## Hi there âœ‹

I am an experienced application developer using decentralized identity (DID) and blockchain based on the technology of the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) security authentication solution.

I was mainly in charge of RESTful API backend development using the Java spring framework. Furthermore, I like to focus on the process of considering and solving problems that occurs during any of business progresses.

In addition, I recently got interested in the performance improvement and practical use of Hyperledger Fabric, a permissioned blockchain platform.

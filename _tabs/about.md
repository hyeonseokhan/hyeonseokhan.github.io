<h3> Hi there âœ‹</h3>
<p>
I am an experienced application developer using decentralized identity (DID) and blockchain that based on the technology of the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) security authentication solution.

I was mainly in charge of RESTful API backend development using the Java spring framework. Furthermore, I like to focus on the process of considering and solving problems that occurs during any of business progresses.

In addition, I recently got interest in the performance improvement and practical use of Hyperledger Fabric, a licensed blockchain platform.
